# Notion-Events
This project aims to capture Notion change events in a page and send them to Apache Kafka.

The python code is reused from Jamie Alexandre [repo](https://github.com/jamalex/notion-py). Thanks to his work, it is simpler to understand how to do real-time update with long polling in Notion.
